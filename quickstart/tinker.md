# Tinker

**Tinker** is a sample project we built on top of our SDKs. It showcases the most common uses of the bunq SDKs and is easy to reuse in your integration.

Run the command in your language of choice to download and open the project.

It is auto connected to the sandbox so you don't need to worry about creating an API key. To switch to the production, [scan the “go pro” QR code](https://together.bunq.com/d/2553-tinker-the-api).
