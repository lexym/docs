# Changelog

## Upcoming changes

### July 2, 2019

1. The _type_ field is becoming mandatory for [_card-debit_](https://doc.bunq.com/#/card-debit)_._
2. We are deprecating the _applied\_limit_ field from the [mastercard\_action](https://doc.bunq.com/#/mastercard-action) responses.
3. We are removing the _activation\_code_ field from [CardUpdate](https://doc.bunq.com/#/card/Update_Card_for_User). Instead of using the field, set the status ACTIVE when the card has been ACCEPTED\_FOR\_PRODUCTION.

### July 9, 2019

We are deprecating the following share-invite-bank endpoints:

* [share-invite-bank-inquiry](https://doc.bunq.com/#/share-invite-bank-inquiry)
* share-invite-bank-inquiry/{ID}/{amount-used\)
* [share-invite-bank-response](https://doc.bunq.com/#/share-invite-bank-response)

You can use the following endpoints instead:

* share-invite-monetary-account-inquiry
* share-invite-monetary-account-inquiry/ID/amount-used
* share-invite-monetary-account-response

### October 8, 2019

We are deprecating creating push notifications through updating _notification\_filters_ in the User and MonetaryAccount objects.

Instead, we are introducing separate endpoints for the callbacks and notifications.

* /v1/user/332/notification-filter-push
* /v1/user/332/notification-filter-url
* /v1/user/336/monetary-account/49/notification-filter-url

## Released

### April 18, 2019

The old card limit fields in the [_card_](https://doc.bunq.com/#/card) and [_card-batch_](https://doc.bunq.com/#/card-batch) objects have been deprecated and replaced with new ones. The default limit of â‚¬1,000 is now applied to all new cards.
